# devutils

My repo for dev utils.

### VisualStudio junk

* **getPkfromSnk**: extract public key from a .snk file.

### Custom git commands

* **rentag**: rename a git tag locally and remotely. Usage: `$ git rentag new_tag old_tag`
* **unsash**: creates a new branch, if branch_name parameter does not correspond to an existing branch, and unstash previous changes in it. Usage: `$ git unstash branch_name`

## How do I install it?! I NEED IT1!!!

On git bash, type `git --exec-path` and copy it's output, which is git execution path. You could also find it under `GITEXECPATH` environment variable.

With git execution path in hands, you can copy git commands into it and call them directly from git bash. \Ãµ/
